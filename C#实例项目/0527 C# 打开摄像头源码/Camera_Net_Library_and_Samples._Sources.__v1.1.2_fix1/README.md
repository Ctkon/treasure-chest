Camera_NET
----------
A .NET library for camera easy use via DirectShow
----------

_**NOTE: There is an [article on CodeProject.com about Camera Net library](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/671407/Camera_Net-Library "Article about Camera_Net Library on CodeProject") and some additional information. Take a look.**_

### Features of the library:
1. Select camera
2. Select resolution
3. Show camera's output
4. Overlay image on the frame
5. Take snapshots of the frame
6. Change TV mode (PAL, NTSC, etc.)
7. Display dialog windows of the camera (from drivers)
8. Get a list of available cameras and resolutions

### About the library
The library was created because I've failed to find a library among dozens of open source solutions that would support what I wanted: easy use of camera as a component, ability to change the camera resolution, take frame snapshots, show overlay images over the frame.

The main classes in the library are CameraControl and Camera.
CameraControl is a UserControl-wrapper for Camera class, easy to use out of box. This approach is recommended.
The library includes two samples of use in WinForms, in particular an example of a simple implementation of the component in your application, and more complicated example that shows almost all features of the library. 
Camera is an object for interaction with cameras.

Additionally there are several public classes: Resolution, VideoInput, camera selection class and etc. 
The library uses DirectShowLib (license LGPL 2.1 or later), which is a very thin wrapper of DirectX COM-interfaces, so that the losses of productivity from the use of managed code instead of the native one are minimal.

DirectShow is MS Windows only, so the library is also available only for Windows.
